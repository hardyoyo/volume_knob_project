# SparkFun Micro Pro Volume Knob Project
* 2020-11-13
* assembled by Hardy J Pottinger IV

A very simple USB volume knob project, using code inspired by: https://learn.adafruit.com/trinket-usb-volume-knob/code
and modified using the info in this tutorial: https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/337
but the biggest thanks is owed to the wonderful example code for the NicoHood HID-Project:
https://github.com/NicoHood/HID/blob/master/examples/Consumer/Consumer.ino

## Requirements
* A SparkFun Micro Pro, but any small Arduino-compatible ought to work, with maybe a few tweaks

## Installation

Load the sketch up in the Arduino IDE, install the board and confirm you have the correct port configured.
I recommend trying a simple blink project from the Arduino examples for your board, just to confirm it works. 
If you brick your board, you can restore it via the reset button or shorting the reset pin to ground.

## Usage

Plug it in, turn the knob. Woohoo, volume knob for your computer!
